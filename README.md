# 🏥 Electronic Health Record (EHR) System  
*A Containerized, Monitored, and Automated Healthcare Application*

---

## 📖 Overview  
This project implements a **cloud-native Electronic Health Record (EHR)** system that securely manages patient data and appointments.  
The system is built using **Node.js, MongoDB, Docker, Kubernetes, Prometheus, Grafana, Ansible, and GitHub Actions**, showcasing a full DevOps lifecycle — from CI/CD to infrastructure automation and monitoring.

---

## 🚀 Features  

- **Frontend (EHR Web UI)** – Built with HTML/CSS/JS, accessible via NodePort service.  
- **Backend (Express.js API)** – Handles patient and appointment data with REST APIs.  
- **Database (MongoDB)** – Stores patient and appointment records persistently.  
- **Containerization (Docker)** – Each component runs in isolated containers.  
- **Orchestration (Kubernetes)** – Deploys and scales the application automatically.  
- **Automation (Ansible)** – Automates environment setup and deployment.  
- **CI/CD (GitHub Actions)** – Builds and pushes Docker images automatically.  
- **Monitoring (Prometheus + Grafana)** – Collects metrics and visualizes application health.
